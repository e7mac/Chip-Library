All binary data is sent and received as unsigned short to maximize accuracy at the bit depth.

Naming Principles
1. All variables should be defined as instance vars so that they can be measured for debugging
2. Start ivars with m. Don't add m to output and inputs.
3. The unsigned int should be named as the variable and a float suffix should be added for the float version
